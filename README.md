# boardgame

boardgame aspires to be a go library that makes it easy to create arbitrarily complex board game progressive web apps.

It is just a hobby project I'm messing around with in my spare time and is most likely in a broken (and wildly incomplete) state. I don't encourage anyone to use it at this point at all. :-)

Real documentation is in the godoc package docs.
