# boardgame

boardgame aspires to be a go library that makes it easy to create arbitrarily complex board game progressive web apps.

It is just a hobby project I'm messing around with in my spare time and is most likely in a broken (and wildly incomplete) state. I don't encourage anyone to use it at this point at all. :-)

The package has a core library to define the game logic and then a server sub-package to create a progressive web app based on that formal logic. Check out boardgame/examples/server for an example server with three games (blackjack, tictactoe, and memory).

Real documentation is in the [godoc package docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/jkomoros/boardgame).
